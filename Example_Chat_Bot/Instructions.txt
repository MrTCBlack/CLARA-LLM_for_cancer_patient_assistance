These are some instructions for how to run this code.

It will contain all the requirements that you will
    need in order to run the chat bot properly.


Step 1: Create a python virtual environment.
    - This will allow you to make any pip installs local
        to just the virtual environment.
    - I am running on Windows Powershell, so the following
        is how I created a virtual environment:

PS> python -m venv .env

        - .env is the directory that I am storing all the
            virtual environment data files in

    - To activate the virtual environent,
        I ran the following command (once again on Windows PowerShell):

PS> <venv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1

        - where <venv> is the path to the directory containing
            the virtual environent (in my case: .env)
    - You can check if your virtual environment has been
        activated by starting up the Python interpreter
        and running the following:

import sys
sys.prefix
sys.base_prefix

        - if the virtual environent has been activated,
            then the last two lines should give different outputs
            - The first should point to the directory of the virtual environment
            - The second should point to the base Python

    - When you are done with your virtual environment,
        enter the following command to deactivate it

deactivate

Step 2: Install the dependencies so you can run the chat bot

pip install transformers accelerate

Step 3: start the chat bot by running the python file:

python Example_ChatBot.pyt
