# CLARA-LLM_for_cancer_patient_assistance
Cancer patients need assistance obtaining accurate, easy-to-understand, and personalized information about their specific diagnosis, treatment options, and available resources. 
To provide patients with such help, this project focuses on developing a large language model trained to access available medical and community resources, specifically within the oncology domain. 

The goal of this project is to develop a proof-of-concept model featuring a user-friendly question-and-answer interface, designed to serve as a supplemental resource for cancer patients alongside professional medical advice.
